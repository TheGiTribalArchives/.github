 1. INTRODUCTION
===============================================================================

Ho ho ho…

So you think you know the story of the Gi, do you? Well, so once did I. Even
after all my years among the stars and the canyon winds, the land still finds
ways to surprise an old sage.

A recent quake opened a hidden system of tunnels far beneath Cosmo Canyon. A
network untouched since the fall of the Gi some 150 years past. Within lay
markings unlike any we had seen before.

We do not yet know their meaning. They differ from the known records that
describe the Gi’s final days. This archive gathers our first attempts at
translating what the stone has guarded in silence all this time.

===============================================================================
 2. DISCOVERY
===============================================================================

The newly exposed path was first entered by Deneh and Nanaki, drawn by shifting
earth and the canyon’s restless breath. They discovered new chambers and
structures, clearly of Gi origin, but the inscriptions were unlike the familiar
tale from the mural of the Gi attack.

Even after so long, the air in those chambers felt still and purposeful, as if
the Gi had carved these markings with intent rather than urgency. This was not
the chaos of their end, but something older. Perhaps a record meant only for
themselves and the canyon to witness.

===============================================================================
 3. PURPOSE OF THIS ARCHIVE
===============================================================================

Much of what the world remembers of the Gi comes from murals depicting their
final assault, but a people cannot be defined solely by their demise. These new
inscriptions offer a rare glimpse into a part of their culture untouched by the
violence that ended them.

By preserving these markings in code we safeguard them for future generations'
study. The stories of the Gi Tribe, not as myth but as fragments of a life once
lived. We do not claim to understand them yet but we must ensure they endure
long enough for understanding to come.

===============================================================================
 4. TRANSLATION METHODOLOGY
===============================================================================

Our approach is deliberate and patient. Each individual carving is examined and
documented. Known Gi motifs guide our comparisons, though we must avoid forcing
meaning onto what we do not yet grasp.

Where erosion and time has caused gaps we first record the absence rather than
guess what once was. Only once a symbol’s shape is certain do we translate it
into code. There will be time later to interpret meaning.

===============================================================================
 5. OBSERVATIONAL CAUTIONS
===============================================================================

These deeper chambers were crafted with intent, not haste. The Gi placed these
markings where only the most trusted or most determined would reach. The canyon
holds a quiet, lingering presence down there. It's not hostile, but aware we
are in this ancient space.

Anyone studying these records should do so with patience. These are not
warnings of battle, nor are they declarations of triumph. They are something
quieter and perhaps more personal. Treat these caves with the respect the Gi
once did.

===============================================================================
 6. CLOSING WORDS
===============================================================================

The canyon reveals its truths only when it chooses. These inscriptions remind
us that the Gi were more than a footnote in Cosmo Canyon’s history. They lived,
thought, planned, taught and left these markings for a reason we have yet to
discover.

May this archive keep their voices safe until the meaning becomes clear.

Ho ho… the canyon still has much to say, and we must be ready to listen.

 7. APPENDIX A — GI EMBLEM (ASCII)

A stylised emblem inspired by motifs found in the deeper Gi chambers:
